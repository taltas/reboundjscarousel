reboundjscarousel
=================

An implementation of a carousel, using Facebook's ReboundJS ( https://github.com/facebook/rebound/tree/master/rebound-js ).

At time of writing, ReboundJS is completely undocumented. With the issues linking  to Brandon Walkin's portfolio for a demo of it's use: https://github.com/facebook/rebound/issues/20

This is an implementation of the carousel seen at that site, wrapped into a customizable jQquery plugin.
